Usage:
- Nessus lets you perform a variety of different scans on a target, with each having a easy-to-use web GUI form where you can enter information about the target system and configure how you want the scan to run
- to create a new (unauthenticated) scan press the "New Scan" button:
	- next, select the type of scan to use as a template
	- then, configure the scan Settings to customise it to your requirements
	- press "Launch" to initiate the scan
- once a scan is complete you can view the possible vulnerabilities present (ranked in order of severity) and carry out an attack 
	- vulnerabilities can be filtered using the "Filter" bar at the top (i.e. "Exploit Avaliable")
	- you can also click on the Settings (gear icon) to Disable Groups to list all vulnerabilities individually
	- Nessus can also be used to generate reports of the vulnerabilities it has found
- to run an authenticated scan with Nessus:
	- click "New Scan", then select "Credential Patch Audit" from the Scan Templates section 
	- next, configure teh scan Settings to your liking 
	- then click on the Credentials tab and the SSH category and enter the SSH credentials of the client you are scanning (make sure SSH is enabled on the target client)
	- then "Launch" the scan as before 
	- for a Windows client you need to enter WMI or RDP credentials 
- Nessus also has a variety of Plugins which can be enabled during a scan to fine-tune a scan -- these are avaliable through the Plugins tab of the Advanced Scan template

## Nmap

> Nmap's NSE is not a full-fledged vulnerability scanner, but can be used to peform automated vulnerability scans by detecting and validating vulnerabilties. Scripts which fall under the "vuln" category detect a vulnerability, while scripts which fall under the "exploit" category attempt to exploit vulnerabilities. You should never run NSE scripts blindly and should always take the time to understand what they are doing before running them.

- NSE scripts can be found in the `/usr/share/nmap/scripts` directory
- this directory also contains the `script.db` file which serves as a index to all of the scripts and defines what category a script falls under 
- to use the NSE to detect a vulnerability: `sudo nmap --script vuln <target>`
	- i.e. `sudo nmap --script vuln 10.11.1.20`
	-
