### 1) Apache Tomcat Enumeration

Default/weak credentials:
- Apache Tomcat servers often use default or weak credentials for admin interface for web apps
- can determine if default credentials are being used by trying to login with [default credentials](https://github.com/netbiosX/Default-Credentials/blob/master/Apache-Tomcat-Default-Passwords.mdown)
- can use automated Metasploit module to check for default credentials:
	- `use auxiliary/scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login` -> set options (most of the time stick with the defaults) -> `set STOP_ON_SUCCESS true` -> `run`

### 2) Apache Tomcat Exploitation

<br>

Upload a malicious .jsp file:
- a) login to the administrative area of the tomcat server
- b) find and customize .jsp file (found in the `/usr/share/laudanum/jsp` directory)
- c) upload and deploy the .jsp file in the Tomcat Manager section 
- d) navigate to the URL the application (.jsp file) has been deployed at
	- i.e. `http://<ip_address>/cmd/cmd.jsp`
- alternatively, you can upload a `.war` Java file which automatically creates are reverse shell and catch this in a listener on your machine
