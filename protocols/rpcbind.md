# rpcbind / portmapper (111)

--- 

> Portmapper and RPCbind run on TCP port 111. RPCbind maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen. RPC processes notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve. The client system then contacts rpcbind on the server with a particular RPC program number. The rpcbind service redirects the client to the proper port number (often TCP port 2049) so it can communicate with the requested service.

### 1) rpcbind / portmapper Enumeration

Enumerate rpcbind:
- with rpcinfo: `rpcinfo -p <target>`
- with nmap NSE: `nmap -p 111 --script=rpc-grind,rpcinfo <target>`
- to show all nmap NSE scripts: `ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/nfs*`
- to run all scripts: `nmap -p 111 --script nfs* <target>`
